### Observer Pattern ###

Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. 

### Mediator Pattern ###

Promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.

### Memento Pattern ###

Capture an object’s internal state and externalize it so that it can be restored to that state later

### Memento Pattern ###

Capture an objectâ€™s internal state and externalize it so that it can be restored to that state later.

### Template Method ###

Define the basic steps of an algorithm and allow the implementation of the individual steps to be changed.

### Strategy Pattern ###

Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
